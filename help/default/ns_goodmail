Help for GOODMAIL:

GOODMAIL allows you to maintain a whitelist of email addresses that
are allowed to be used to register accounts.  Any email not on this
list will not be allowed to be registered.

These email addresses are saved to the Atheme database and are kept
between services restarts.

In GOODMAIL ADD, you are able to use glob matching to whitelist email
addresses that match a pattern.

Syntax: GOODMAIL ADD <email> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GOODMAIL ADD jdhore1@gmail.com bar reason
    /msg &nick& GOODMAIL ADD *@aol.com bar reason
    /msg &nick& GOODMAIL ADD *@*.tk foo reason

GOODMAIL DEL allows you to remove entries from the list of currently
whitelisted email addresses.

Syntax: GOODMAIL DEL <email>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GOODMAIL DEL foo@bar.com
    /msg &nick& GOODMAIL DEL *@aol.com

GOODMAIL LIST allows you to list the currently whitelisted email
addresses.

Syntax: GOODMAIL LIST

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GOODMAIL LIST
